July 7, 2023

## Overview

This is a draft example of how we might centralize the population indicator compilation across regions. Steph initiated this as a trial for discussion among the population group (Eric, Bruno, Steph). The idea would be to mirror the headings in the [tech-report](https://bookdown.org/salmonwatersheds/tech-report/).
