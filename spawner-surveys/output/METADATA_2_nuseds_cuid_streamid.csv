"IndexId","2_nuseds_cuid_streamid","Combination of SPECIES_QUALIFIED and POP_ID"
"POP_ID","all_areas_nuseds","Population ID."
"GFE_ID","all_areas_nuseds","Stream ID (Geo_Feature ID)."
"SPECIES","all_areas_nuseds","Species of Fish."
"POPULATION","all_areas_nuseds","Default naming originates from previous databases as a concatenation of stream name, subdistrict, species and run type. This is the most important piece of data that all the other SEN data fields refers to."
"WATERBODY","all_areas_nuseds","This is the name of the waterbody or portion of a waterbody that bounds the population as shown on any given SEN."
"AREA","all_areas_nuseds","This is the subdistrict. In most cases subdistricts are the same as statistical areas. They mainly differ for streams that eventually drain into the Fraser and for large areas that have been split up and thus have a/b/c... designations. E.g. Statistical area 03 has two subdistricts 3A and 3B."
"Year","2_nuseds_cuid_streamid","Same as ANALYSIS_YR in all_areas_nuseds"
"MAX_ESTIMATE","2_nuseds_cuid_streamid","Calculated by PSF and previously present in NuSEDS: The maximum value (excluding NAs) among the following fields in NuSEDS: NATURAL_ADULT_SPAWNERS, NATURAL_JACK_SPAWNERS, NATURAL_SPAWNERS_TOTAL, ADULT_BROODSTOCK_REMOVALS, JACK_BROODSTOCK_REMOVALS, TOTAL_BROODSTOCK_REMOVALS, OTHER_REMOVALS, TOTAL_RETURN_TO_RIVER"
"ENUMERATION_METHODS","all_areas_nuseds","The enumeration method used to observe fish. The first method listed is the primary method. Values are: Bank Walk, Based on Angling Catch, Biologist/Working Group, Boat, Broodstock Removal, Dead Pitch, Electronic Counters, Electroshocking, Enumeration by Hatchery, Fence, Fixed Wing Aircraft, Float, Helicopter, Hydroacoustic Station, Other, Peak Live and Dead Count, Redd Counts, Snorkel, Spot Checks, Stream Walk, Strip Counts, Tag Recovery, Trap, Walk."
"ESTIMATE_CLASSIFICATION","all_areas_nuseds","This categorizes estimates based on their levels of accuracy and precision (Type-1 are the most accurate, Type-6 the least accurate). There are three other classifications that belong to SENs whose source data were migrated from the regional MSAccess SILBC16 database (definitions extracted from that user manual).RELATIVE: CONSTANT MULTI-YEAR METHODS andRELATIVE: VARYING MULTI-YEAR METHODS: 'This is the case with survey methods restricted to a fraction of the spawning habitat and/or a fraction of the spawning period. There are various types of relative abundance estimates depending on the survey method, the level of standardization of the methods, and the sampling effort.  For our purpose we have retained one type based on between-year consistency of the method where there are two levels.'NO SURVEY THIS YEAR: 'stream was not inspected for that species this year' "
"ESTIMATE_METHOD","all_areas_nuseds","There are several standard methods to chose from.Addition/Subtraction - simple addition or subtraction to provide an estimate. Should be used in conjunction with activity types Adjustment/Calibration and Summary observations. E.g. a population aggregate, the sum of two or more populations, would require the linking of two or more SENs and straight summation of the estimates.Multiplication/Division - simple multiplication or division to summary estimates. This method should be used in conjunction with activity type Adjustment/Calibration. E.g. E.g. An annual estimate that was arrived at by Peak Live Plus Dead analysis can be adjusted by some factor to make it equivalent to a Time Series estimate that uses AUC calculations.Area Under the Curve - Combining a series of point estimates for abundance to create an estimate for the annual abundance. This is done by determining the total area under a curve of abundance by time then dividing by the survey life (the average length of time that an individual is available to be observed alive i.e. is still within the survey area and is not dead).Peak Live Plus Dead - Examine point estimates for abundance, determine the survey when the maximum live count observed; sum the live and dead counts for that survey to create the annual estimate. Peak Live Plus Cumulative Dead - Examine point estimates for abundance, determine the survey when the maximum live count observed. Sum the live count for that survey with the cumulative total of the dead counts prior to and including that survey to create the annual estimate.Fixed Site Census - Combining one or more raw observations into a single estimate (e.g. add all daily fence observation SIL to create a single annual estimate).Mark and Recapture - Petersen - Use capture and re-capture SIL data to determine an abundance estimate with the Petersen calculation.Mark and Recapture - Jolly-Seber - Use capture and re-capture SIL data to determine an abundance estimate with the Jolly-Seber calculation.Redd Count - Using counts of redds from SILs and multiplied by a factor such as 2.Lake Expansion - expanding the dead recoveries by the recovery effortCumulative New - N/A"
